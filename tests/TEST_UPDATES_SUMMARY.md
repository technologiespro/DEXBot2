# Test Suite Updates - Based on Recent Bugfixes

This document summarizes the comprehensive test suite updates added based on the last 10 bugfixes (commits from 2026-01-09).

## Overview
Added two new test files to detect and prevent regressions from critical bugfixes:
- `tests/test_strategy_logic.js` - Strategy engine rebalancing and placement logic
- `tests/test_accounting_logic.js` - Fund tracking and fee accounting

## Bugs Detected and Tests Added

### 1. VIRTUAL Order Placement Capping Bug (b913661)
**Problem**: VIRTUAL orders couldn't activate because their sizes were capped by availablePool, preventing activation of orders with pre-allocated capital.

**Tests Added** (strategy.test.js):
- ✅ `should activate VIRTUAL orders at full allocated size regardless of availablePool`
- ✅ `should only cap size INCREASE, not full order size for VIRTUAL orders`

**What These Tests Catch**:
- Ensures VIRTUAL orders can activate even when availablePool=0
- Verifies only new capital consumption is capped, not pre-allocated amounts

---

### 2. PARTIAL Order Update Bug (b913661)
**Problem**: Non-dust PARTIAL orders weren't being updated, preventing rebalancing when opposite side filled.

**Tests Added** (strategy.test.js):
- ✅ `should update dust PARTIAL orders to target size`
- ✅ `should update non-dust PARTIAL orders for grid rebalancing`

**What These Tests Catch**:
- Detects when PARTIAL orders don't receive update operations
- Verifies both dust and non-dust PARTIALs are handled correctly

---

### 3. Grid Divergence & Stale Cache (c02b66d)
**Problem**: Stale in-memory cache causing false divergence detections during grid comparisons.

**Tests Added** (strategy.test.js):
- ✅ `should detect divergence when grid is reloaded`
- ✅ `should maintain consistent grid state after persistence reload`

**What These Tests Catch**:
- Ensures fresh data is used for divergence checks
- Prevents false positives from stale cache

---

### 4. BoundaryIdx Persistence & Recovery (d17ece6)
**Problem**: Boundary index not persisting across restarts, causing grid misalignment.

**Tests Added** (strategy.test.js):
- ✅ `should initialize boundaryIdx from startPrice on first run`
- ✅ `should recover boundaryIdx from existing BUY orders`
- ✅ `should persist boundaryIdx across rebalance operations`

**What These Tests Catch**:
- Verifies boundary index is properly initialized and recovered
- Ensures grid zones maintain proper BUY/SELL separation

---

### 5. BUY Side Geometric Weighting - Reverse Parameter (d17ece6)
**Problem**: Wrong reverse parameter for BUY side weighting, causing incorrect capital distribution.

**Tests Added** (strategy.test.js):
- ✅ `should use correct reverse parameter for BUY side weighting`
- ✅ `should concentrate BUY capital near market price`

**What These Tests Catch**:
- Ensures BUY orders get maximum weight at market-closest positions
- Verifies geometric weighting follows expected distribution

---

### 6. Fund Tracking Integration (32d81ea)
**Problem**: Bootstrap flag and fund tracking integration not tracking spread correction properly.

**Tests Added** (strategy.test.js):
- ✅ `should deduct available funds after new placements`
- ✅ `should not double-deduct for updates and rotations`

**What These Tests Catch**:
- Verifies fund tracking is correct during placement operations
- Prevents double-deduction for rotations

---

### 7. Rotation Completion (265772d)
**Problem**: Rotations being skipped instead of completing after divergence checks.

**Tests Added** (strategy.test.js):
- ✅ `should complete rotations without skipping`
- ✅ `should not skip rotations when divergence check succeeds`

**What These Tests Catch**:
- Ensures rotations are always executed
- Prevents grid gaps from incomplete rotations

---

### 8. Fee Calculation with isMaker Parameter (d17ece6)
**Problem**: Missing isMaker parameter in getAssetFees calls causing crashes.

**Tests Added** (strategy.test.js):
- ✅ `should correctly process fills with isMaker parameter`
- ✅ `should account for both maker and taker fees in fill processing`

**What These Tests Catch**:
- Ensures isMaker parameter is properly handled
- Detects fee calculation crashes

---

### 9. Market & Blockchain Taker Fees (7b0a5c5)
**Problem**: Not accounting for both market and blockchain taker fees in fill processing.

**Tests Added** (accounting.test.js):
- ✅ `should account for market taker fees in SELL order proceeds`
- ✅ `should account for blockchain taker fees in fill processing`
- ✅ `should correctly calculate net proceeds with both fee types`

**What These Tests Catch**:
- Verifies both fee types are deducted
- Prevents fund leaks from fee miscalculation

---

### 10. Fund Precision & Delta Validation (0a3d24d)
**Problem**: Precision loss and delta validation issues in fund calculations.

**Tests Added** (accounting.test.js):
- ✅ `should maintain precision when adding multiple orders`
- ✅ `should detect fund delta mismatches`
- ✅ `should validate fund totals after state transitions`

**What These Tests Catch**:
- Detects floating-point precision errors
- Verifies fund invariants are maintained
- Catches lost or phantom funds

## Test Coverage Summary

| Category | Test Count | Coverage |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Placement Capping | 2 | VIRTUAL order activation |
| PARTIAL Handling | 2 | Dust & non-dust updates |
| Grid Divergence | 2 | Cache & reload logic |

| Fund Precision | 3 | Precision & delta validation |
| **Total** | **23** | **All critical bugfixes** |

## Key Assertions

These tests use critical assertions to catch regressions:

1. **Size Assertions**: Verify order sizes are correct (no capping, no loss)
2. **State Assertions**: Confirm order states transition properly (VIRTUAL→ACTIVE→PARTIAL)
3. **Fund Invariants**: Ensure total funds = virtual + committed (no leaks)
4. **Index Assertions**: Validate boundaryIdx consistency across operations
5. **Fee Assertions**: Confirm both fee types are accounted for

## Running Tests in CI/CD

These tests are integrated with the existing test suite:

```bash
# Full test run (includes new tests)
npm test

# Run individual test file
node tests/test_strategy_logic.js
```

## Notes for Developers

- Tests use `manager.pauseFundRecalc()` / `resumeFundRecalc()` for batch operations
- Fee cache is mocked where necessary to avoid external dependencies
- All tests are async-safe and handle rebalance promises correctly
- Tests clean up state in `beforeEach()` to ensure isolation

## Fill Batching & Recovery Regression Tests (Feb 7-8, 2026)

The tests above target individual bugfixes discovered during normal operation. The tests below target a different failure class: **cascading failures under market stress**. These were written after the Feb 7 crash where 29 rapid fills exposed race conditions in batch processing, orphan-fill handling, and recovery retry logic.

### Overview

Coverage for the Feb 7 market crash post-mortem fixes is now split across active test files. These tests ensure fill batching, recovery retry system, and orphan-fill deduplication remain robust.

### Test Coverage

**Fill Batching & Recovery Retries**:

| Test | File | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `simulateBatching` | `tests/sim_batching.js` | Verifies fixed-cap behavior: `<=MAX_FILL_BATCH_SIZE` unified; larger queues chunked at max 4 |
| `recovery retry cooldown and reset` | `tests/test_accounting_logic.js` | Validates count+time-based retry system with cooldown and retry counter behavior |
| `testSingleStaleCancelBatchUsesStaleOnlyFastPath` | `tests/test_patch17_invariants.js` | Ensures stale-cleaned order IDs prevent double-crediting of delayed orphan fills |

**Cache & Stale-Order Handling**:

| Test | File | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `testGridResizeRespectsBudgetAfterCap` | `tests/test_patch17_invariants.js` | Verifies capped grid resize never allocates above budget and preserves correct remainder behavior |
| `testIllegalBatchAbortArmsMaintenanceCooldown` | `tests/test_patch17_invariants.js` | Ensures illegal-state batch hard-abort arms `_maintenanceCooldownCycles` |
| `testSingleStaleCancelBatchUsesStaleOnlyFastPath` | `tests/test_patch17_invariants.js` | Validates single-op stale cancel recovery avoids unnecessary full sync |

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run fixed-cap batching simulator
node tests/sim_batching.js

# Run recovery retry coverage
node tests/test_accounting_logic.js

# Run batch hard-abort/stale-cancel/capped-resize invariants
node tests/test_patch17_invariants.js
```

### Test Details

#### Test 1: Fixed-Cap Batch Pipeline

**Scenario**: Simulate 29 fills arriving over 90 seconds of market crash

**Validation**:
- ✅ Fixed-cap batching enforced (max 4 fills per broadcast)
- ✅ All fills processed in ~8 broadcasts instead of 29
- ✅ Processing time reduced from ~90s to ~24s
- ✅ Single rebalance call per batch (not per-fill)
- ✅ Cache funds credited once per batch

**Configuration Tested**:
```javascript
MAX_FILL_BATCH_SIZE: 4
```

#### Test 2: Recovery Retry Mechanism

**Scenario**: Recovery fails once, should retry automatically

**Validation**:
- ✅ First recovery attempt fails, recorded in state
- ✅ Retry counter increments (1/5)
- ✅ Retry blocked before 60s interval elapses
- ✅ After 60s, retry succeeds
- ✅ State reset on success (count=0, time=0)
- ✅ Periodic sync also triggers state reset

**Configuration Tested**:
```javascript
RECOVERY_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS: 60000  // 60 second minimum
MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS: 5            // Max 5 retries
```

#### Test 3: Orphan-Fill Deduplication

**Scenario**: Batch fails (stale order), cleanup recorded, orphan fill arrives later

**Validation**:
- ✅ Stale order ID recorded with timestamp when batch fails
- ✅ Orphan fill event arrives for same order ID
- ✅ Guard check (`_staleCleanedOrderIds.has(orderId)`) returns true
- ✅ Proceeds NOT credited (double-credit prevented)
- ✅ Log shows `[ORPHAN-FILL] Skipping double-credit`
- ✅ TTL pruning removes entries after 5 minutes

#### Test 4: Cache Remainder Parity

**Scenario**: Grid resize capped by available funds

**Validation**:
- ✅ Ideal grid total: 1000 BTS
- ✅ Available funds: 600 BTS
- ✅ Allocated: 600 BTS (track per-slot applied sizes)
- ✅ Unallocated remainder: 400 BTS (1000 - 600, not inflated)
- ✅ Next cycle gets correct 400 BTS available for allocation
- ✅ No "stuck fund" situations

#### Test 5: Hard-Abort Cooldown Arming

**Scenario**: Batch execution fails with illegal state or accounting error

**Validation**:
- ✅ Primary hard-abort path arms cooldown (50 cycles)
- ✅ Retry hard-abort path also arms cooldown
- ✅ Maintenance doesn't run immediately after abort
- ✅ Next maintenance cycle respects cooldown
- ✅ Log shows `[COOLDOWN] Arming maintenance cooldown after hard-abort`

#### Test 6: Single-Op Stale-Cancel Fast-Path

**Scenario**: Single order in batch becomes stale on-chain

**Validation**:
- ✅ Batch contains only 1 operation
- ✅ Stale order detected during execution
- ✅ Fast-path recovery applied (not full sync)
- ✅ Cleanup performed locally (stale ID recorded)
- ✅ No expensive `synchronizeWithChain()` call
- ✅ Log shows `[STALE-CANCEL] Single-op batch stale recovery (fast-path)`

### Test Statistics

3. **Stale ID Assertions**: Validate orphan deduplication map behavior
4. **Cache Remainder Assertions**: Verify per-slot allocation tracking
5. **Cooldown Assertions**: Confirm hard-abort arms maintenance cooldown
6. **Fast-Path Assertions**: Verify single-op stale recovery doesn't trigger full sync

### Integration with CI/CD

Fill batching tests are part of the main test suite:

```bash
# Full test suite
npm test

# Targeted fixed-cap batching and recovery tests
node tests/sim_batching.js && node tests/test_accounting_logic.js && node tests/test_patch17_invariants.js
```

### Regression Prevention

These tests catch regressions in:
- Fill batch processing logic (fixed-cap sizing)
- Recovery retry state management (count+time system)
- Orphan-fill deduplication guards (stale ID tracking)
- Remainder calculation (per-slot accuracy)
- Hard-abort cooldown arming (both paths)
- Stale-order fast-path recovery (single-op optimization)

## Test Cleanup & Deprecation (Feb 28, 2026)

### Removed Obsolete Tests

The following 5 test files were removed as they referenced deprecated APIs or tested internal implementation details:

| Test File | Reason | Coverage |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `test_rotation_fallback_recheck.js` | Cleanup verification only; verifying old helper functions were removed | Other tests cover rotation logic |
| `test_grid_funding_manual.js` | References removed `Grid.updateGridOrderSizesForSide()` API | Strategy module tests cover grid sizing |
| `test_fee_refinement.js` | Tests old accounting behavior; proceeds now consumed immediately | `test_bts_fee_accounting.js`, `test_fee_backwards_compat.js` |
| `test_fill_queue_logic.js` | Unit tests internal `_consumeFillQueue` implementation detail | Integration tests & COW pipeline tests cover fills |
| `test_fix_proceeds_fee_deduction.js` | Uses removed OrderManager methods | `test_accounting_logic.js`, `test_bts_fee_accounting.js` |

**Impact**: No regression risk. All removed functionality is covered by current active tests.

**Migration Path**: If these test scenarios need specific coverage in the future, implement through:
1. Public API tests rather than internal implementation details
2. Integration tests for end-to-end behavior
3. Scenario-based tests in COW pipeline test suite

---

## Future Maintenance

When adding new bugfixes:
1. Create a test that would have caught the bug
2. Add it to the appropriate test file (strategy.test.js, accounting.test.js, or test_patch*.js)
3. Reference the commit hash in a comment
4. Update this summary document
5. Ensure test covers both success and failure paths
6. **Test maintenance**: Remove tests that reference deprecated APIs or internal details no longer in use

This ensures continuous regression detection and documents the evolution of the test suite.
