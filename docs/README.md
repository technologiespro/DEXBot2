# DEXBot2 Documentation

This directory contains the comprehensive technical documentation for the DEXBot2 trading bot. It is designed to guide developers from high-level architecture down to the nuances of fund accounting and state management.

**Version context:** v0.7.15 is the current working version. This patch carries quiet orderbook candles forward through bounded no-trade gaps so book-sourced bots keep refreshing dynamic-grid snapshots during ordinary silence, and highlights active bot names in launcher/status output for faster runtime visibility.

### 📊 [Grid Recalculation](GRID_RECALCULATION.md)
*When and why the grid resets.*
- **Reset Sources**: Market-adapter bootstrap, AMA delta, AMA-slope range reset, RMS divergence correction, and fund regeneration
- **Configuration**: Per-source thresholds, whitelist requirements, and defaults
- **Trigger Execution**: How `profiles/recalculate.<botKey>.trigger` is consumed under the fill-processing lock

### 📝 [Logging System](LOGGING.md)
*Observability and debugging.*
- **Severity Levels**: Guidelines on using `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `debug`.
- **Log Rotation**: Configuration for managing log file sizes and retention.
