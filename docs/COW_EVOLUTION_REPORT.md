## Phase 1: Initial Implementation (Feb 14, 2026)

### Commit: `71abeb88` - feat: implement Copy-on-Write (COW) grid architecture

**Objective:** Replace snapshot/rollback pattern with cleaner COW approach.

**Architecture:**
```
Old Pattern (Removed):
1. Modify master grid directly (optimistic)
2. Broadcast to blockchain
3. No recovery mechanism on failure

New COW Pattern:
1. Create WorkingGrid (clone of master)
2. Modify working copy
3. Broadcast to blockchain
4. On success: atomic swap (working → master)
5. On failure: discard working (master unchanged)
```

**Files Created:**
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `modules/order/working_grid.js` | WorkingGrid class for COW wrapper |
| `modules/order/utils/grid_indexes.js` | Index building utilities |
| `modules/order/utils/order_comparison.js` | Epsilon-based order comparison |
| `tests/test_cow_master_plan.js` | Core COW tests (11 cases) |
| `tests/test_working_grid.js` | WorkingGrid unit tests |
| `tests/benchmark_cow.js` | Performance benchmarks |

**Key Methods Introduced:**
- `_applySafeRebalanceCOW()` - Creates working grid, runs planning
- `_reconcileGridCOW()` - Delta reconciliation against working copy
- `_commitWorkingGrid()` - Atomic swap from working to master

---

## Phase 2: Initial Bug Fixes (Feb 14, 2026)

### Commit: `804ff55` - fix: correct COW implementation and remove legacy code

**Issues Fixed:**
1. **Missing Object.freeze in commit** - Master grid wasn't frozen after commit
2. **Delta re-validation at commit time** - Added validation before commit
3. **Working grid reference cleanup** - Centralized `_clearWorkingGridRef()` method

**Legacy Code Removed:**
- Duplicate `recalculateFunds()` wrapper
- Dead `_applySafeRebalance` wrapper

---

## Phase 3: Deadlock & Concurrency Fixes (Feb 15, 2026)

### Commit: `710e1d3` - fix: resolve COW deadlocks, sync issues, and lock routing

**Problems:**
- Deadlocks during concurrent fill processing
- Lock contention between sync paths
- Working grid state inconsistency during broadcasts

**Solutions:**
- Refined lock acquisition order
- Added lock-free paths for read operations
- Improved working grid synchronization during fills

### Commit: `2cca420` - fix: critical post-commit cleanup and fee dedup memory hardening

**Key Changes:**
- Memory leak in fee deduplication cache
- Post-commit cleanup race conditions
- LRU cache with proper eviction (10,000 entries, 6-hour TTL)

---

## Phase 4: State Centralization (Feb 15, 2026)

### Commit: `4312230` - refactor: centralize COW state/action semantics and guard flow

**Problem:** COW action/state literals duplicated across manager and broadcast paths.

**Solution:** Added shared constants:

```javascript
// modules/constants.js
const REBALANCE_STATES = {
    NORMAL: 'NORMAL',
    REBALANCING: 'REBALANCING',
    BROADCASTING: 'BROADCASTING'
};

const COW_ACTIONS = {
    CREATE: 'CREATE',
    UPDATE: 'UPDATE',
    CANCEL: 'CANCEL',
    ROTATE: 'ROTATE'
};
```

**Helper Methods Added:**
- `isRebalancing()` / `isBroadcasting()` / `isPlanningActive()`
- `_syncWorkingGridFromMasterMutation()`
- `_buildAbortedCOWResult()`
- `_summarizeCowActions()`

---

## Phase 5: Architecture Hardening (Feb 16-17, 2026)

### Commit: `1fed7f2` - fix: COW architecture hardening - eliminate all in-place mutations

**Three-Pass Hardening:**

#### Pass 1: Prevent direct mutations of frozen objects
- `syncFromFillHistory` mutated `rawOnChain.for_sale` on frozen objects
- `initializeAccount` mutated persisted grid array in-place
- `loadGrid` directly set order state during phantom sanitization

#### Pass 2: Eliminate remaining in-place mutations
- `assignGridRoles` now returns new array instead of mutating
- `syncBoundaryToFunds` returns update object instead of mutating manager
- Replaced `Object.assign` calls with spread reassignments

#### Pass 3: Final cleanup
- `_setAccountTotals` uses spread reassignment
- `updateProcessedFillsBatch` eliminates in-place mutations
- Refined boundary sync with strict object identity comparison

**Pattern Established:**
```javascript
// Before (mutation):
Object.assign(updatedOrder, nextOrder);

// After (immutable):
updatedOrder = { ...updatedOrder, ...nextOrder };
```

---

## Phase 6: Fill Handling Refinement (Feb 16-17, 2026)

### Multiple commits for fill handling edge cases

**Key Commits:**
- `c620098` - Harden fill rebalance sizing and COW operation consistency
- `fce0f0b` - COW accounting invariant violation fix (new orders must remain VIRTUAL)
- `9022942` - Align COW fill rebalance with main-style batching
- `766fe37` - Stabilize COW rotation accounting and BTS fee application

**Fill Processing Strategy:**

| Scenario | Scope | Action | Risk |
|----------|-------|--------|------|
| Individual fill | Single slot | Process immediately | Low |
| Divergence update | Entire side | Block if fills pending | High |
| Cache threshold update | Entire side | Block if fills pending | High |

---

## Phase 7: Divergence Migration (Feb 17, 2026)

### Commit: `d322445` - fix: complete divergence COW migration and unify action planning

**Before (Queue-Based):**
```javascript
ordersNeedingPriceCorrection.push({ gridOrder, chainOrderId, isSurplus: true });
await updateOrdersOnChainBatchFn({ ordersToCancel, ordersToPlace, ordersToRotate });
```

**After (COW-Based):**
```javascript
const workingGrid = new WorkingGrid(manager.orders);
workingGrid.set(orderId, convertToSpreadPlaceholder(order));
const actions = [{ type: COW_ACTIONS.CANCEL, id, orderId }, ...];
await updateOrdersOnChainBatch({ actions, workingGrid, ... });
```

**Key Changes:**
1. Surplus orders: CANCEL on-chain and virtualize in working grid
2. State preservation: ACTIVE/PARTIAL orders keep their state
3. No race conditions: Master unchanged until blockchain confirms

---

## Phase 8: Atomic Boundary Shifts (Feb 18, 2026)

### Commit: `86ab205` - fix: keep boundary shifts atomic in COW divergence updates

**Problem:** Boundary index changes during divergence correction were threaded through manager state before COW commit completed.

**Solution:** Introduced `pendingBoundaryIdx` to carry boundary changes through the COW pipeline:

```javascript
const boundarySync = syncBoundaryToFunds(manager);
if (boundarySync.changed) {
    pendingBoundaryIdx = boundarySync.newIdx;  // NOT manager.boundaryIdx!
    // manager.boundaryIdx updated atomically in _commitWorkingGrid
}
```

---

## Phase 9: State Management Consolidation (Feb 19, 2026)

### Commit: `f9bc182` - refactor: consolidate duplicate state tracking into StateManager

**Phases 1-4:**
- Extracted `StateManager` class for unified state tracking
- Consolidated rebalance state, working grid reference, and abort controller
- Reduced duplicate state fields across manager and dexbot_class

### Commit: `4cb3430` - refactor: remove redundant rawOnChain deep-clone

**Optimization:** WorkingGrid._cloneOrder no longer deep-clones rawOnChain since it's only read, not mutated.

---

## Phase 10: Final Hardening (Feb 20-21, 2026)

### Commit: `b27619a` - fix: eliminate COW rebalance invariant race

**Problem:** COW commit path triggered fund recalculation before optimistic accounting was applied.

**Solution:**
- Made `_commitWorkingGrid` recalculation optional via `skipRecalc` option
- Replaced positional-boolean APIs with explicit options objects

### Commit: `7dbbb49` - fix: harden COW fill handling and accounting invariants

**Key Fixes:**
- BTS fee handling aligned with operation-fee lifecycle
- Fill/rebalance flow hardened against race conditions
- Edge cases in concurrent fill processing

---

## Phase 11: Stable-Theory Invariant Sealing (Feb 22, 2026)

### Commit: `9ef800d` - fix: preserve PARTIAL size in COW projection

**Problem:** `projectTargetToWorkingGrid` could overwrite an on-chain `PARTIAL` order's actual remaining `size` with ideal geometric `targetSize`.

**Why this was critical:** `reconcileGrid` intentionally does not emit non-rotation in-place UPDATE actions for this path, so no blockchain resize occurs. Accounting then risked counting ideal size as committed, causing false fund-invariant failures (`trackedTotal > blockchainTotal`).

**Solution:**
- Preserve `current.size` when order identity is retained and state is `PARTIAL`.
- Normalize preserve-path size to finite, non-negative value for safety.
- Remove redundant `hasOnChainId` condition where `isOrderOnChain` already guarantees chain identity.

**Regression Coverage Added:**
- `COW-018`: PARTIAL on-chain size is preserved in projection.
- `COW-018b`: ACTIVE orders still follow target size (scope guard).
- `COW-018c`: malformed PARTIAL preserve-path size is normalized safely.

**Operational Impact:**
- Prevents spurious CRITICAL fund-invariant alerts after partial fills.
- Reduces self-healing churn and avoids waiting for periodic sync to self-correct projection overstatements.

## Architecture Evolution Summary

### State Machine

```
NORMAL → REBALANCING → BROADCASTING → _commitWorkingGrid() → NORMAL
                                          ↓ (on failure)
                                    _clearWorkingGridRef() → NORMAL
                                        (master unchanged)
```

### Key Invariants Established

1. **Master Immutability:** Master grid is frozen and never directly modified
2. **Atomic Commit:** Working grid commits atomically only after blockchain success
3. **Version Tracking:** Commit guards reject stale/version-mismatched grids
4. **Fill Priority:** Individual fills always processed immediately with working grid sync
5. **API Safety:** All mutation APIs use explicit options objects, not positional booleans

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Hybrid Freeze + COW** - Runtime enforcement catches bugs COW alone wouldn't
2. **Centralized Constants** - Single source of truth for states/actions
3. **Options Objects** - Prevented ordering bugs from positional booleans
4. **Comprehensive Tests** - Caught edge cases early

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Deadlocks** - Required careful lock acquisition ordering
2. **In-place Mutations** - Required three passes to fully eliminate
3. **Fill Synchronization** - Complex state machine during concurrent operations
4. **API Consistency** - Migrated all call sites to options pattern

---

## Conclusion

The COW implementation represents a significant architectural improvement that:
- Eliminated the possibility of state corruption during blockchain failures
- Simplified debugging with clear before/after states
- Reduced code complexity by ~55 lines of snapshot/rollback logic
- Provided transactional semantics for all grid modifications

The seven-day intensive development period produced a robust, well-tested architecture that is now the foundation for all order management operations in DEXBot2.
