# Modules

This is the core runtime of DEXBot2 — the part that actually places orders, tracks fills, and manages the grid on the BitShares blockchain. Entrypoint files (`dexbot.ts`, `unlock.ts`, `pm2.ts` in the repo root) launch and orchestrate what lives here.

Everything below covers bot lifecycle, order management, blockchain connectivity, fill processing, grid maintenance, credential security, and MPA/credit workflows — all the code that isn't an entrypoint, adapter, analysis tool, or bridge.

## Where to Start

If you're new to the codebase, read these files in order (~20 minutes):

1. **`constants.ts`** — all tuning parameters and defaults live here; gives you a map of the system's knobs
2. **`dexbot_class.ts`** — the top-level orchestrator; shows how bot startup, fill processing, and maintenance connect
3. **`order/manager.ts`** — the central controller for the grid; read the constructor and `_applySafeRebalanceCOW()`
4. **`order/grid.ts`** — how the geometric grid is generated and sized

After those four, branch out into `order/accounting.ts` (fund tracking), `order/strategy.ts` (rebalancing logic), and `dexbot_fill_runtime.ts` (fill processing pipeline).

```

In plain terms: the **entrypoints** (in the repo root) start processes and hand off to the **launcher**, which boots the credential daemon and bot supervisor. **`dexbot_class.ts`** is the main orchestrator — it wires together the fill runtime (reacts to fills as they happen), the maintenance runtime (periodic sync and grid health checks), and the credit runtime (MPA/debt workflows). The **order subsystem** (`order/`) owns the grid: generating it, syncing it with the blockchain, tracking funds, and rebalancing. The **native client** (`bitshares-native/`) handles all direct blockchain communication so no external trading libraries are needed.

External consumers — other parts of DEXBot2 interact with modules through these touchpoints:

- **`market_adapter/`** — the price adapter reads tuning constants from `constants.ts` and writes trigger files that `dexbot_maintenance_runtime.ts` picks up to decide when to regenerate the grid
- **`claw/`** — the AI bridge layer reads bot profiles and uses the credential client to sign transactions on behalf of the decision loop
- **`analysis/`** — research scripts reference constants and types to fit AMA parameters and generate charts

## Design Principles

- **Zero runtime dependencies** — no npm trading/blockchain libraries; the native client, crypto, and serialization are all in `bitshares-native/`. This eliminates supply-chain risk and keeps the bot fully self-contained.
- **Copy-on-write** — `order/working_grid.ts` provides isolated COW mutations; master grid is immutable during rebalance. The grid is never modified in-place; a working copy is built, mutated, and committed atomically only after blockchain operations succeed.
- **Fund-driven boundary sync** — the grid rebalances based on available funds, not arbitrary triggers; no forced allocations. When a fill arrives, the system calculates what it can actually afford and adjusts the grid around that.
- **Replay-safe accounting** — fill processing in `dexbot_fill_runtime.ts` uses `processed_fill_store.ts` to prevent double-counting. If the bot restarts mid-fill, it can safely replay without creating duplicate orders.
- **Daemon-backed signing** — the credential daemon holds decrypted keys; modules never handle raw private keys. If the main bot crashes, keys stay encrypted on disk — only the small daemon process sees them.
- **Fixed-cap batch processing** — fill batches are capped (default 4) to keep blockchain broadcasts predictable. Even if 20 fills arrive at once, they're processed in small chunks to avoid overwhelming the chain.
