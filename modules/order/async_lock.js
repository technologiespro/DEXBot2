/**
 * modules/order/async_lock.js - AsyncLock Engine
 *
 * Distributed mutual exclusion for async operations.
 * Exports a single AsyncLock class that prevents concurrent execution of critical sections.
 *
 * Solves the Time-of-Check vs Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition
 * where checking a flag and setting it are not atomic operations.
 *
 * In JavaScript async code, multiple callbacks can interleave between
 * check and set operations. This lock ensures only one caller can
 * enter a critical section at a time, with fair FIFO queueing.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const lock = new AsyncLock();
 *
 *   const result = await lock.acquire(async () => {
 *       // Critical section - guaranteed only one execution at a time
 *       // Even if other callers check lock while this runs, they will wait
 *       return someAsyncOperation();
 *   });
 *
 * ===============================================================================
 * TABLE OF CONTENTS - AsyncLock Class (6 methods)
 * ===============================================================================
 *
 * INITIALIZATION (1 method)
 *   1. constructor() - Create new AsyncLock with empty queue and unlocked state
 *
 * LOCK ACQUISITION (1 method)
 *   2. acquire(callback) - Acquire lock and execute callback exclusively (async)
 *      Returns promise that resolves with callback result
 *      Queues request if lock is already held, processes in FIFO order
 *
 * QUEUE PROCESSING (1 method - internal)
 *   3. _processQueue() - Process queued callbacks one at a time (async, internal)
 *      Marks as locked, executes callback, handles errors, unlocks, processes next
 *      Recursive: processes next item after each callback completes
 *
 * STATUS QUERIES (3 methods)
 *   4. isLocked() - Check if lock is currently acquired
 *   5. getQueueLength() - Get number of operations waiting for lock
 *   6. clearQueue() - Reject and discard all pending queued operations
 *      Returns: number of operations that were cleared
 *      Does NOT stop the currently executing operation
 *
 * ===============================================================================
 *
 * RACE CONDITION PREVENTION:
 * Problem: Check-then-act is not atomic in async code:
 *   if (!locked) {
 *       locked = true;  // <-- Another callback can run here!
 *       doWork();
 *   }
 *
 * Solution: FIFO queue with exclusive execution:
 *   1. Queue callback and handlers
 *   2. Set _locked = true (prevents concurrent entry)
 *   3. Execute callback (guaranteed alone)
 *   4. Set _locked = false and process next queued item
 *
 * REENTRANCY WARNING:
 * This lock is NOT reentrant. If a function holding the lock attempts to
 * acquire it again (nested call), it will DEADLOCK as the second request
 * will wait forever in the queue for the first one to release it.
 *
 * CRITICAL INVARIANTS:
 * - _locked = true ONLY if callback is currently executing
 * - At most one callback in "await callback()" at any time
 * - All queued callbacks are guaranteed exclusive access
 * - If _locked = false and queue is empty, no operations pending
 *
 * ===============================================================================
