# Margin Trading

Reference skill for margin position management on BitShares DEX.

Covers the trading concepts available through the claw bridge, the mechanics of MPA debt positions, the HONEST.Asset ecosystem properties that shape how positions behave, and the position management principles that govern capital deployment.

The practical control model is split into:

- structural settings that are usually kept fixed (`incrementPercent`, `targetSpreadPercent`, `activeOrders`)
- adaptive settings layered on top of AMA (`weightDistribution`, min/max range ratio, debt/collateral actions)
